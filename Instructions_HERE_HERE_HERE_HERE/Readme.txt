Instructions to install solutions 

Github :=> https://github.com/silotech-it/VirtualMindTest

There you can find all three solutions I created.

1) VirtualMind, is the restful api that solves all CRUD and also all foreign currencies.
	You can direct ask for Dolar, Real, Peso and User in the URL. With this solution running, 
using Postman, you can order get, get:id, post, put and delete.

2) VirtMVC, is the mvc that consumes VirtualMind in a more ellegant way and can deal with data, letting VirtualMind 
	do all the business work.

3) VirtualMind.Tests is the unit test project created since the beginning and for this reason, has some testes there.

After getting all stuff from Github, prior to run, you might need to install from nuget: (That's not reasons for, but...)
	a) ASP NET WEB API CLIENT, Microsoft (Dev...)
        b) AlertifyJS (Mohammad something)

4) for the Users, all the related docs are here: https://github.com/silotech-it/VirtualMindTest/tree/master/VirtualMind/DatabaseScripts

5) Javascript Questions and Aswers are here: https://github.com/silotech-it/VirtualMindTest/tree/master/VirtualMind/JavascriptTests

6) There is a movie where I show this solution running in my notebook.


Thanks!
